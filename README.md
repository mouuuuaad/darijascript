  ila (n < 0) {
    rmmi("Factoriel ma kayench l raqam salib.");
  }
  ila (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    rj3 1;
  }
  bdl result = 1;
  douz (bdl i = 2; i <= n; i = i + 1) {
    result = result * i;
  }
  rj3 result;
}

bdl num = 12;
jrb {
  bdl fact = factorial(num);
  tbe3("Factoriel dyal " + num + " houwa: " + fact);
} msk(e) {
  ghlat(e);
}
